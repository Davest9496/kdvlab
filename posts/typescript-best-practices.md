# TypeScript Best Practices for React

TypeScript has become the standard for modern React development, offering powerful type safety and enhanced developer experience. Let's explore the best practices that will elevate your React applications.

## Component Typing Strategies

### Props Interface Definition
Always define clear interfaces for your component props:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const Button: React.FC = ({
  variant,
  size = 'md',
  children,
  onClick,
  disabled = false
}) => {
  return (
    
      {children}
    
  );
};
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Generic Components
Create reusable components with generics:

```typescript
interface ListProps {
  items: T[];
  renderItem: (item: T) => React.ReactNode;
  keyExtractor: (item: T) => string;
}

function List({ items, renderItem, keyExtractor }: ListProps) {
  return (
    
      {items.map((item) => (
        
          {renderItem(item)}
        
      ))}
    
  );
}
```

These patterns will significantly improve your code quality and development experience!
