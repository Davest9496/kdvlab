# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 represents a significant leap forward in React-based web development, offering unprecedented performance and developer experience improvements. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and show you how to build modern web applications.

## What's New in Next.js 14

### App Router Revolution
The App Router introduces a new paradigm for routing in Next.js applications:

- **Server Components by default** - Better performance and SEO
- **Streaming and Suspense** - Progressive page loading
- **Layout system** - Shared UI across routes

### Performance Improvements
Next.js 14 brings significant performance enhancements:

```typescript
// Example of optimized loading
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { PostList } from './components/PostList';

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    Loading posts...}>
      
    
  );
}
```

## Key Features to Explore

1. **Server Actions** - Full-stack functionality
2. **Improved bundling** - Faster builds
3. **Enhanced TypeScript support** - Better type safety
4. **Optimized images** - Automatic optimization

This is just the beginning of what's possible with Next.js 14!

# TypeScript Best Practices for React

TypeScript has become the standard for modern React development, offering powerful type safety and enhanced developer experience. Let's explore the best practices that will elevate your React applications.

## Component Typing Strategies

### Props Interface Definition
Always define clear interfaces for your component props:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const Button: React.FC = ({
  variant,
  size = 'md',
  children,
  onClick,
  disabled = false
}) => {
  return (
    
      {children}
    
  );
};
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Generic Components
Create reusable components with generics:

```typescript
interface ListProps {
  items: T[];
  renderItem: (item: T) => React.ReactNode;
  keyExtractor: (item: T) => string;
}

function List({ items, renderItem, keyExtractor }: ListProps) {
  return (
    
      {items.map((item) => (
        
          {renderItem(item)}
        
      ))}
    
  );
}
```

These patterns will significantly improve your code quality and development experience!
